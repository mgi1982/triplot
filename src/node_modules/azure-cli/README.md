# Getting Started
## Download Source Code

To get the source code of the SDK via **git** just type:

    git clone https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-sdk-tools-xplat.git
    cd ./azure-sdk-tools-xplat
    npm install 

## Install the npm package

You can install the azure cli npm package directly. 

    npm install -g azure-cli

# Using the cli

The azure cli has several top-level commands, which correspond to different features of Windows Azure. Each top-level command is then broken up into further sub commands. Typing "azure" by itself or "azure --help" will list out each of the sub commands.

Below is a list of some of the more common commands and explanations on how to use them. 

## azure account - Managing Azure accounts

In order to use the CLI, you must first import credentials.

    azure account download
Download your credentials from Windows Azure. Logs you in to the Azure portal and downloads a publishsettings file.

    azure account import [file]
Imports previously downloaded credentials

### azure account storage - Manage Azure Storage accounts

You can create and manage store accounts for leveraging blobs, tables and queues within your applications.

    azure account storage list
Lists all your storage accounts

**--git** - create a git repo for deploying the application. Will call "git init" to initialize the local folder as repo and will add an "azure" remote for the remote repository. --publishingUsername can be used for scripting scenarios. If publishing user is not provider, you will be prompted. ex. "azure site create foo --git".

**--github** - connect this website to a github repo. If run in a local repo, will use the remotes present. --githubusername / --githubpassword / -- githubrepository can be used for scripting scenarios. If these are not provided, you will be prompted. ex. "azure site create foo --github"

**Note:** Above [site] is not required if the command is run in the main app folder.

### azure site config - Managing site app settings

# Contribute Code or Provide Feedback

If you would like to become an active contributor to this project please follow the instructions provided in [Windows Azure Projects Contribution Guidelines](http://windowsazure.github.com/guidelines.html).

If you encounter any bugs with the library please file an issue in the [Issues](https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-sdk-for-node/issues) section of the project.

## Running tests

The tests included in the repository execute CLI commands against live Widows Azure management endpoints. In order to run the tests, you must have a Windows Azure subscription as well as a GitHub account. 

Before running tests, you must take a one-time action to configure the CLI with the Windows Azure subscription by running

```
azure account download
azure account import
```

Next, provide the following parameters by setting environment variables:

- `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` - your Windows Azure Storage Account name
- `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY` - secret access key to that Storage Account
- `AZURE_SERVICEBUS_NAMESPACE` - your Windows Azure Service Bus Namespace
- `AZURE_SERVICEBUS_ACCESS_KEY` - secret access to that Service Bus namespace
- `AZURE_GITHUB_USERNAME` - GitHub account username
- `AZURE_GITHUB_PASSWORD` - GitHub account password
- `AZURE_GITHUB_REPOSITORY` - name an empty GitHub repository to use during tests (e.g. `tjanczuk/clitest`)

To run the tests, call

```
npm test
```

from the root of your clone of the repository. Most tests execute against live Windows Azure management APIs, and running them takes considerable time. 

Note: by default, the tests targeting the Windows Azure Mobile Services run against a mocked Windows Azure HTTP endpoints. In order to execute these tests against live Windows Azure management APIs instead, set the `NOCK_OFF=true` environment variable before running the tests.
