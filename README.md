TriPlot: Geolocated images plotter and showcase site

This app allows the user to upload her travel pictures and the app will Plot the trip on a Google Map and associated timeline for viewing.

Uses the GPS metadata added by some cameras in the header of the picture and
Google Maps to render with a marker the point were that picture was taken.

This is part of the work that we did in the #Hackthonpy 2012.
